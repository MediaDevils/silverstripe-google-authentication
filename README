====================================
  Google Authentication Module 1.1
         For SilverStripe
====================================
Developed and maintained by RentBox

====================================

Installation:
- Extract google folder to your site root
- Run /dev/build

This adds two extra fields to the Member table, GoogleIdentity and GoogleName.
OAuth tokens *are not* requested. You can not use this module for communicating
with Google beyond the sign in process.

This module adds a button to MemberFormFields, but not FrontendField. You can
add your own button as well. For an example of how to do so, have a look at
GoogleIdentifier, google.js and the three related methods in GoogleCallback.
